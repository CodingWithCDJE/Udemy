"""
You are given an integer array nums sorted in ascending order (with distinct values). Prior to being passed
to your function, nums is possibly rotated at an unknown pivot index k (1 <= k < nums.length).

For example, [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7] might be rotated at pivot index 3 and become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]. Given an integer
target, return the index of target if it is in the array, else return -1. You must right an algorithm with
O(log n) runtime complexity.

Time complexity: O(log n) => Average and worst
Best => O(1)

Space complexity: O(1)
